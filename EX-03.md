-- (k) List the total number of employees and the average salaries of the different departments.
SELECT DEPTNO, COUNT(*) AS num_employees, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO;

-- (l) Calculate the total number of employees.

FROM EMP;

-- (m) Calculate the total number of managers.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_managers
FROM EMP

-- (n) Calculate the number of employees who are not getting any commission.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS no_commission_count
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM IS NULL;

-- (o) Calculate the number of employees who are getting any commission.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS commission_count
FROM EMP
WHERE COMM IS NOT NULL;

-- (p) List the details of all managers in ascending order of joining dates.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB = 'MANAGER'
ORDER BY HIREDATE ASC;

-- (q) List the average salaries for each different job.
SELECT JOB, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB;

-- (r) Display the average salary for each different job.
-- (same as (q))
SELECT JOB, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB;

-- (s) Display the minimum, maximum, and average salaries for each job group.
SELECT JOB, MIN(SAL) AS min_salary, MAX(SAL) AS max_salary, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB;

-- (t) Find all departments which have less than 3 employees.
SELECT DEPTNO
FROM EMP
GROUP BY DEPTNO
HAVING COUNT(*) < 3;

-- (u) List the details of the employees in ascending order of department number, and within each department, in descending order of salary.
SELECT *
FROM EMP
ORDER BY DEPTNO ASC, SAL DESC;

-- (v) Display the name, deptno, and annual salary of each employee in order of salary and deptno.
SELECT ENAME, DEPTNO, SAL * 12 AS annual_salary
FROM EMP
ORDER BY SAL ASC, DEPTNO ASC;

-- (w) Display the name of the employee who earns the maximum salary.
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP);

-- (x) Display the name of the employee who earns the minimum salary.
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL = (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP);

-- (y) Display the name of the employee who earns the maximum salary whose job is salesman.

WHERE JOB = 'SALESMAN' AND SAL = (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'SALESMAN');

-- (z) Display the name of the employee who earns the minimum salary whose job is clerk.
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB = 'CLERK' AND SAL = (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP WHERE JOB = 'CLERK');

-- (aa) Display the department number whose average salary is maximum.
SELECT DEPTNO
FROM (SELECT DEPTNO, AVG(SAL) AS avg_salary
      FROM EMP
      GROUP BY DEPTNO)
ORDER BY avg_salary DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
```
