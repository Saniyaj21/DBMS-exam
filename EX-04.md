Sure, let's add explanations to each query to better understand how they work.

### (a) List all employee names, department names, and the city, in department name order.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, D.DNAME, D.LOC
FROM EMP E
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
ORDER BY D.DNAME;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), department name (`DNAME`), and city (`LOC`).
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables based on the common `DEPTNO` field.
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results by department name (`DNAME`).

### (b) List all employee names, department numbers, department names, and salaries.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.DEPTNO, D.DNAME, E.SAL
FROM EMP E
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), department number (`DEPTNO`), department name (`DNAME`), and salary (`SAL`).
- Similar to (a), the `JOIN` clause connects the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO`.

### (c) List all employees working in Dallas in descending order of salary.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.SAL
FROM EMP E
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
WHERE D.LOC = 'DALLAS'
ORDER BY E.SAL DESC;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`) and salary (`SAL`).
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those employees who work in Dallas (`D.LOC = 'DALLAS'`).
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order of salary (`SAL`).

### (d) List all employeesâ€™ names, jobs, salaries, and department names for everyone in the company except clerks. Sort the report with respect to job and salary.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME, E.JOB, E.SAL, D.DNAME
FROM EMP E
JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
WHERE E.JOB <> 'CLERK'
ORDER BY E.JOB, E.SAL;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), job (`JOB`), salary (`SAL`), and department name (`DNAME`).
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO`.
- The `WHERE` clause excludes employees whose job is 'CLERK' (`E.JOB <> 'CLERK'`).
- The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results first by job (`JOB`) and then by salary (`SAL`).

### (e) List all employee names who work in the same city as an employee named 'FORD'.
```sql
SELECT E1.ENAME
FROM EMP E1
JOIN DEPT D1 ON E1.DEPTNO = D1.DEPTNO
WHERE D1.LOC = (
    SELECT D2.LOC
    FROM EMP E2
    JOIN DEPT D2 ON E2.DEPTNO = D2.DEPTNO
    WHERE E2.ENAME = 'FORD'
);
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`).
- The `JOIN` clause connects the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO`.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only those employees who work in the same location (`LOC`) as 'FORD'.
- The subquery (`SELECT D2.LOC FROM EMP E2 JOIN DEPT D2 ON E2.DEPTNO = D2.DEPTNO WHERE E2.ENAME = 'FORD'`) finds the location (`LOC`) where 'FORD' works.

### (f) Display the name of the department that has no employee.
```sql
SELECT D.DNAME
FROM DEPT D
LEFT JOIN EMP E ON D.DEPTNO = E.DEPTNO
WHERE E.EMPNO IS NULL;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the department name (`DNAME`).
- A `LEFT JOIN` is used to include all records from the `DEPT` table and matching records from the `EMP` table.
- The `WHERE` clause filters the results to include only departments where no employees are assigned (`E.EMPNO IS NULL`), which means there are no matching `EMPNO` entries in the `EMP` table.
