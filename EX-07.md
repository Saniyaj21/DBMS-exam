Here are the SQL queries for each of the given tasks in Experiment No. â€“ 07:

### (a) List all employees who work in Dallas or have joined the company as manager before 82.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO 
AND (D.LOC = 'DALLAS' OR (E.JOB = 'MANAGER' AND HIREDATE < TO_DATE('01-JAN-1982', 'DD-MON-YYYY')));
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the department location (`LOC`) is 'DALLAS' or the employee's job (`JOB`) is 'MANAGER' and they were hired before January 1, 1982 (`HIREDATE < TO_DATE('01-JAN-1982', 'DD-MON-YYYY')`). The `EMP` and `DEPT` tables are joined on `DEPTNO`.

### (b) List all employees who work in Boston and earn more than any employee working in Chicago.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP E1, DEPT D1
WHERE E1.DEPTNO = D1.DEPTNO 
AND D1.LOC = 'BOSTON' 
AND E1.SAL > (SELECT MAX(E2.SAL) 
              FROM EMP E2, DEPT D2 
              WHERE E2.DEPTNO = D2.DEPTNO 
              AND D2.LOC = 'CHICAGO');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the department location (`LOC`) is 'BOSTON' and the salary (`SAL`) is greater than the maximum salary of any employee in 'CHICAGO'. The subquery finds the maximum salary in 'CHICAGO'.

### (c) List the name of the employee who earns the minimum salary.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL = (SELECT MIN(SAL) FROM EMP);
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the salary (`SAL`) is equal to the minimum salary (`MIN(SAL)`) in the `EMP` table.

### (d) List all employees who work in the same post as Smith.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB = (SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'SMITH');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the job (`JOB`) matches the job of SMITH. The subquery finds SMITH's job.

### (e) List all employees who earn the lowest salary in their respective department.
```sql
SELECT ENAME, DEPTNO, SAL
FROM EMP E1
WHERE SAL = (SELECT MIN(SAL)
             FROM EMP E2
             WHERE E2.DEPTNO = E1.DEPTNO);
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), department number (`DEPTNO`), and salary (`SAL`) from the `EMP` table where the salary matches the lowest salary in their respective department. The subquery finds the minimum salary for each department.

### (f) List all employees who earn more than every employee in the 'Sales' department.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL > ALL (SELECT SAL 
                 FROM EMP E, DEPT D 
                 WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND D.DNAME = 'SALES');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the salary (`SAL`) is greater than the salary of every employee in the 'SALES' department. The subquery finds all salaries of employees in the 'SALES' department.

### (g) Find the job with the highest average salary.
```sql
SELECT JOB, AVG(SAL) AS AVG_SALARY
FROM EMP
GROUP BY JOB
ORDER BY AVG_SALARY DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the job (`JOB`) and its average salary (`AVG(SAL)`) from the `EMP` table. It groups results by job and orders by average salary in descending order, fetching only the first row to find the job with the highest average salary.

These queries address the specified tasks and utilize various SQL concepts, such as joins, subqueries, grouping, and aggregate functions, to extract the required information from the database.
