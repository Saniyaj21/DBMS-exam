Let's break down and solve each of these queries step by step, using the provided table structures and data.

### (a) List the employees who earn more than any employee in CHICAGO.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL > (SELECT MAX(SAL) FROM EMP E, DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND D.LOC = 'CHICAGO');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the salary (`SAL`) is greater than the maximum salary of any employee in the department located in CHICAGO. The subquery finds the maximum salary of employees in CHICAGO.

### (b) List the names of the employees who work in the same department as SMITH.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE DEPTNO = (SELECT DEPTNO FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'SMITH');
```

- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the department number (`DEPTNO`) matches the department number of SMITH. The subquery finds the department number for SMITH.

### (c) List the name, employee number, their manager's name, and manager's number.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME AS EMPLOYEE_NAME, E.EMPNO AS EMPLOYEE_NO, M.ENAME AS MANAGER_NAME, E.MGR AS MANAGER_NO
FROM EMP E
LEFT JOIN EMP M ON E.MGR = M.EMPNO;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), employee number (`EMPNO`), manager name (`M.ENAME`), and manager number (`MGR`). It joins the `EMP` table on itself using `LEFT JOIN` to match employees with their managers.

### (d) List the names of the employees whose job is the same as CLARK's.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE JOB = (SELECT JOB FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'CLARK');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the job (`JOB`) matches the job of CLARK. The subquery finds the job for CLARK.

### (e) List the names of the employees whose salary is more than TURNER's.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL > (SELECT SAL FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'TURNER');
```
**Explanation:**

### (f) List the names of the employees who joined after ALLEN.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE HIREDATE > (SELECT HIREDATE FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'ALLEN');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the hire date (`HIREDATE`) is after ALLEN's hire date. The subquery finds ALLEN's hire date.

### (g) Display the name of the department whose job is SALESMAN.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT D.DNAME
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND E.JOB = 'SALESMAN';
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects distinct department names (`DNAME`) from the `DEPT` table where the job (`JOB`) in the `EMP` table is 'SALESMAN'. It joins the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO`.

### (h) Display the name of the department in which FORD works.
```sql
SELECT D.DNAME
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND E.ENAME = 'FORD';
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the department name (`DNAME`) from the `DEPT` table where FORD works. It joins the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO` and filters by FORD's name.

### (i) Display the name of the department whose salary is maximum.
```sql
SELECT D.DNAME
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO
GROUP BY D.DNAME
ORDER BY SUM(E.SAL) DESC
FETCH FIRST 1 ROW ONLY;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the department name (`DNAME`) from the `DEPT` table where the total salary (`SUM(SAL)`) is the highest. It groups results by department name and orders by total salary in descending order, fetching only the first row.

### (j) Display the name of the city (location) in which SMITH works.
```sql
SELECT D.LOC
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND E.ENAME = 'SMITH';
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the location (`LOC`) from the `DEPT` table where SMITH works. It joins the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO` and filters by SMITH's name.

### (k) Display the name of the city in which the manager works.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT D.LOC
FROM EMP E, DEPT D
WHERE E.MGR IS NOT NULL AND E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects distinct locations (`LOC`) from the `DEPT` table where managers (`MGR`) work. It joins the `EMP` and `DEPT` tables on `DEPTNO` and filters for non-null manager values.

### (l) Display the grade of the employee named MARTIN.
```sql
SELECT S.GRADE
FROM EMP E, SALGRADE S
WHERE E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL AND E.ENAME = 'MARTIN';
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the grade (`GRADE`) from the `SALGRADE` table for the employee named MARTIN. It joins the `EMP` and `SALGRADE` tables based on the salary range (`SAL BETWEEN LOSAL AND HISAL`) and filters by MARTIN's name.

### (m) List the employees who earn more than every employee in DALLAS.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL > ALL (SELECT SAL FROM EMP E, DEPT D WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND D.LOC = 'DALLAS');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the salary (`SAL`) is greater than every employee's salary in DALLAS. The subquery finds all salaries of employees in DALLAS.

### (n) Display the name of the department which has no employee.
```sql
SELECT D.DNAME
FROM DEPT D
WHERE D.DEPTNO NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO FROM EMP);
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the department name (`DNAME`) from the `DEPT` table where there are no employees. The subquery finds all distinct department numbers in the `EMP` table.

### (o) List the name, employee number, and the name, employee number of their managers' manager.
```sql
SELECT E.ENAME AS EMP_NAME, E.EMPNO AS EMP_NO, M1.ENAME AS MANAGER_NAME, M1.EMPNO AS MANAGER_NO, M2.ENAME AS MANAGERS_MANAGER_NAME, M2.EMPNO AS MANAGERS_MANAGER_NO
FROM EMP E
LEFT JOIN EMP M1 ON E.MGR = M1.EMPNO
LEFT JOIN EMP M2 ON M1.MGR = M2.EMPNO;
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects the employee name (`ENAME`), employee number (`EMPNO`), manager name (`M1.ENAME`), manager number (`M1.EMPNO`), manager's manager name (`M2.ENAME`), and manager's manager number (`M2.EMPNO`). It joins the `EMP` table on itself twice to match employees with their managers and their managers' managers.

### (p) List the names of the employees who joined in the same year as ADAMS.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
FROM EMP
WHERE TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY') = (SELECT TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY') FROM EMP WHERE ENAME = 'ADAMS');
```
**Explanation:**
- This query selects employee names (`ENAME`) from the `EMP` table where the hire year (`TO_CHAR(HIREDATE, 'YYYY')`) matches ADAMS's hire year. The subquery finds ADAMS's hire year.

### (q) List the names of the employees who joined in the same month as BLAKE.
```sql
SELECT ENAME
